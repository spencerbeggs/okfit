# Ghost workspace

A **ghost workspace** in this repository is a pnpm workspace member that
the tooling treats as fully real -- `workspace:*` dependencies resolve,
turbo and vitest-agent see it as an ordinary project -- while being
deliberately excluded from the paths that matter for a shippable package:
it is never versioned by changesets, never built with a `savvy.build.ts`,
never counted toward release scope, and its tests never gate CI.

[scratchpad](../modules/scratchpad.md) is the repository's one instance.
It earns "ghost" status through three simultaneous exclusions: it is
listed in the `ignore` array of `.changeset/config.json`, it is skipped
by the vitest discover strategy whenever the `CI` environment variable is
set, and its directory sits in the root coverage `exclude` list. None of
those exclusions alone would justify the term -- a package can be
`ignore`d by changesets without being a ghost -- the term names the
*combination*, a member that is structurally present but functionally
invisible everywhere except local development.

The distinction that matters in practice: the workspace's **committed
shell** (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `lib/`,
`__test__/utils/`) is real, reviewed content held to the repository's
ordinary quality bar, while its **working areas** (`probes/`,
`__test__/*.test.ts`) are gitignored and disposable, reseeded from
templates on every reset. Reading "ghost" as "nothing here is real" is
the trap: only the working areas are ephemeral, and mistaking a
committed file for a scratch file -- or vice versa -- is exactly the
mistake the term exists to prevent.
