# @okfit/lsp

The `okfit-lsp` bin: an LSP server over stdio that publishes engine
diagnostics for a discovered bundle in any LSP client, Claude Code
included; the server writes nothing, ever, to the bundle.

## Layout

```text
src/
  version.ts     -- LSP_VERSION, read from process.env.__PACKAGE_VERSION__, a
                     build-time constant the bundler injects -- never a
                     package.json import
  errors.ts      -- LspError: the one failure a request handler may return
  index.ts       -- public barrel; this is what later tasks and tests import
```

The Layout tree above is a map, not a substitute for reading source: it
names files and their headline exports, not every symbol. Later tasks
extend this tree; read the file before assuming its export list from this
tree alone.

Tests live in `__test__/`, never in `src/`; see `__test__/CLAUDE.md`.

## Rules

- No file under `src/` reads `process` except `bin.ts`, `main.ts` and
  `version.ts` -- `version.ts`'s `process.env.__PACKAGE_VERSION__` is not a
  runtime read at all: the bundler replaces it with a string literal at
  build time (K-32).
- No file under `src/` writes to stdout: no `process.stdout`, no
  `console.log`/`info`/`debug`/`table`.
- Only `src/protocol/reference.ts`, `src/main.ts` and the type-only
  `src/protocol/types.ts` (created in Task 2) may import from
  `vscode-languageserver*`. A feature imports the seam
  (`../protocol/LspTransport.js`) and the engine, never the library
  directly; a feature that needs a protocol method it does not have adds
  it to the seam first.
- `now` is read once per revalidate at the server boundary (`DateTime.now`)
  and passed into the engine; nothing in the engine reads a `Clock`.
- Effect v4 only, at the version in `catalog:effect`. Consult
  `.repos/effect/packages/effect/src` for what v4 exports; `node_modules`
  wins on disagreement.
- Relative imports use `.js` extensions; built-ins use `node:`. Type
  imports are separate `import type` statements. TSDoc `@public` on every
  `src/` export. Tab indentation.
- Commits are conventional, DCO signed, and never on `main`.
